# Tricycle-UTurn-Demo
MATLAB code for an assignment from ME390 (Vehicle Systems Dynamics and Controls, UT Austin Spring 2018) showing a kinematic model of tricycle making a UTurn. Download everything in one folder, and run "tricycle_sim_UTurn.m". If source code was not written by me, appropriate credits are given in the doc strings. 

You can find a description of the model and my approach to UTurn lane following in this post : https://surajrpawar.github.io/2021-12-27-tricycle/
